<p style="font-family: yellowtail; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;">Surf N' Turf is a Surf and Skate shop started in Seal Beach, California by Jackson Payan.</p>
<p style="font-family: yellowtail; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;">He had the idea of bringing the old school surfing and skateboarding culture of eveyone being invited to be together as one. And that is what we hope to bring to the people of the world. </p>
<p style="font-family: yellowtail; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;">We choose to set up in Southern California because we htought that it is the ideal place to set up a surf shop especially in Seal Beach because we feel like the peole there are more inviting and reflect the culture that we want to bring to the peple of Southern California and the world.</p>
